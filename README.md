This is an extension for chromium based browsers, allowing you to easily get the download_item command for steamCMD

## Usage:
1. Go to the desired steam workshop. In this example we will use [Garry's Mod.](https://store.steampowered.com/app/4000/Garrys_Mod/)
2. Check the URL. In this example https://steamcommunity.com/app/4000/workshop/ is undesired. While something like https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/browse/?appid=4000&browsesort=trend&section=readytouseitems is.
3. Hover over the desired Item's image, then right-click the image.
4. Go down to the "WorkshopDownloader" menu and click "Get SteamCMD command from image"
5. It should alert you that it's copied the command to the clipboard if you followed these steps correctly.
### DOM Picker:
If you'd like to use the dom picker, you will follow a different set of steps.

1. Follow steps 1 and 2 from "Usage".
2. Click on the extension's icon in your toolbar (assuming you have it pinned.)
3. Click "Start Picker".
4. Hover over the desired item's image, and you should see a box over it.
5. Click and you will have the command copied to your clipboard.
- Note, if you enabled "Alert?" It will alert you if the command was copied.
